These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine. The development environment runs entirely in Docker containers.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.
